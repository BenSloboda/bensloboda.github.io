                  <p style="float:left;"> One of the first recipes I made was so unconventional I still can't believe it. I was thinking of Turkish Delight (a jellied dessert from Turkey that is typically made with rosewater). I thought to myself, how hard could it be to draw the scent of a rose out from the petal itself? The answer is this fantastic drink, bringing all the subtleties of a rose with a hint of sweetness to your table. The roses are an unnamed variety, but each flower that bends itself for the bottle brings us a little closer to their beauty. </p>

                    <p style="float:left;"> This carrot vodka was a suggestion from my friend Marco, who thought he was stumping me with an impossible task. I grew two carrots in the garden, harvested them, and shredded them into three different vessels with vodka. To one, I added honey and sugar; to another, I added home grown rosemary; to the third, I added nothing. I then had a blind taste test at a large gathering and the honey was too sweet. The normal carrot was deemed pretty good by most. However, the rosemary carrot was agreed upon as an 'amazing dram', thus 'The Marco' was born. This carrot vodka is steeped with a few sprigs of rosemary to give it an almost savory flavour. The sugars in the carrot come through and it is great mixed as a standard vodka tonic. </p>

                    <p style="float:left;"> I wasn't a coffee drinker until I moved to New Zealand. I remember the first coffee I had at some random petrol station between Auckland and Wellington. It was fantastic. I've tried to have it every day since. New Zealand has some of the best coffee in the world, and I don't know if it is appreciated. This liquor was created with a local coffee-maker who creates his own coffees. This was made with their house blend, a bit of vanilla, and some white pepper to create earthy, sweet tones. The first batch was too sweet, as was the second, and the third. By the fourth batch, I was pretty sure the sweetness was inherent in the beans themselves. The number 6 is the standard bean grind, giving the coffee (steeped in vodka to brew) a coarse surface area to provide these wonderful flavors. </p>

                    <p style="float:left;"> I spiral cut the apples to provide the largest surface area for the alcohol to penetrate and draw out the lucious flavours. When I first started, the cinnamon was just random store-bought cinnamon sticks, and they kept leaving a bitter taste (to me). It was then I found out most cinnamon sticks are actually the bark of the cassia tree, which can be quite bitter when drawn out by the alcohol. The 'true' cinnamon is verum, or Ceylon, cinnamon. This is the sweet, lighter cinnamon flavor that I wanted for this apple pie vodka. </p>

                    <p style="float:left;"> My wife always liked black licorice flavors, and I wanted her to experience Ouzo. My father had traveled to Greece and talked about drinking cool Ouzo in the hot sun while resting on the pristine beaches. I found a recipe for Original Ouzo that called for both star anise and aniseed. As I thought these were two names for the same spice, I just doubled the amount of anise in the recipe. These are not two names for the same spice! Star anise has about twice the licorice power of aniseed. Star anise looks like these small star-shaped seed pods with dark brown rounded seeds. Aniseed is striped seeds that almost look like fennel. Star anise are actually in the magnolia family, and aniseed is a parsley. Watch out for 'fake' star anise, which can be toxic. I only buy NZ grown star anise from a trusted source. </p>
